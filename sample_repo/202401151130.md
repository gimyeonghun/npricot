# Niklas Luhmann and the Zettelkasten Method

Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998) was a German sociologist who developed the Zettelkasten (slip-box) method for managing knowledge.

## His System

Luhmann's paper-based system contained over 90,000 notes and enabled him to write 70+ books and 400+ articles. His approach emphasized:

- **Atomic notes**: One idea per note
- **Linking**: Each note connected to others
- **Numbering**: Hierarchical yet flexible organization
- **Continuous development**: Ideas evolved through connection

## Modern Applications

His methods influence contemporary [[202401151030]] and inspire digital tools. The principles apply to:

- [[202401151100]] implementation  
- [[202401151115]] practice

## Legacy and Influence

Luhmann's work demonstrates how systematic note-taking can amplify thinking. Modern practitioners adapt his methods using digital tools, as explored in [[202401151200]].

The Zettelkasten method shows how individual notes become more valuable through connection - a principle that underlies many current knowledge management approaches.
